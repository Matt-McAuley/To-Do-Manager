# Todo-List-React

## Description
This project is a 'Todo' manager which allows for the creation, editing, and deleting of
projects that each contain their individual 'Todos'. These 'Todos' have a title, description,
due date, and priority. They are organized by due date and can likewise be created, edited, and deleted. This project was built using Typescript and React, with emotion/styled utilized
for CSS in TS. I learned how to build a modular frontend with TSX, React, and functional programming which has many features and is aesthetically pleasing.
